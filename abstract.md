My project revolves around the early detection of states that potentially could be entering or nearing a drought or dry-phase, and seeing if there are nearby states or counties within a particular state that themselves are not in danger and thus could provide aid. Droughts are one of the worst things to happen to a state, as in addition to creating shortages of drinking water, they lead to a myriad of other problems including air quality, sanitation and hygiene, food and nutrition, and the overall economy of a state. Using an open-source forecasting tool called Prophet, released by Facebook, I created a model that takes in historical monthly precipitation from all counties in California and determines the risk it is in of drought. able to detect droughts long before they occur based off common data, such as precipitation patterns. The results were validated against data from the US Drought Monitor's own drought predictor, and it performed very well. The model creates a dictionary which is then fed into a choropleth-map generator to conveniently display the results.
