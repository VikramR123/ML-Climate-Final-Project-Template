My project revolves around the early detection of states that potentially could be entering or nearing a drought or dry-phase, and seeing if there are nearby states or counties within a particular state that themselves are not in danger and thus could provide aid. Droughts are one of the worst things to happen to a state a they have a huge impact on crop yield, food production, and the overall economy of a state. Using machine learning, I plan to create a model that will be able to detect droughts long before they occur based off common data, such as precipitation patterns.
